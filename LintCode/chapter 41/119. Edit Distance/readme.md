Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to convert word1 to word2. (each operation is counted as 1 step.)

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

- Insert a character
- Delete a character
- Replace a character
# Example
## Example 1:
```

"horse"
"ros"

```
Example 2:

exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
```
