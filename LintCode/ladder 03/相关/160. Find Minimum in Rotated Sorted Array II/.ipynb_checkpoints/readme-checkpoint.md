Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).

Find the minimum element.

# Example
## Example 1:
```
Input :[2,1]
Output : 1.
```
Example 2:
```
Input :[4,4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output : 0.
```
# Notice
The array may contain duplicates.
