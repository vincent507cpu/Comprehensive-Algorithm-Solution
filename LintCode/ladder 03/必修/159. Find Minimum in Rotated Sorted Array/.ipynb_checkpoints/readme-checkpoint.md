Suppose a sorted array in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `0 1 2 4 5 6 7` might become `4 5 6 7 0 1 2`).

Find the minimum element.

Example 1:
```
Input：[4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]
Output：0
Explanation：
The minimum value in an array is 0.
```
Example 2:
```
Input：[2,1]
Output：1
Explanation：
The minimum value in an array is 1.
```
### Notice
You can assume no duplicate exists in the array.
