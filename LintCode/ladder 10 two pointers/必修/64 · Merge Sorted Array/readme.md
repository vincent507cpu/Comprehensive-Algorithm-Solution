# Description
Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.

> You may assume that A has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from B. The number of elements initialized in A and B are m and n respectively.
# Example
## Example 1:
```
Input：[1, 2, 3] 3  [4,5]  2
Output：[1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation:
After merge, A will be filled as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
## Example 2:
```
Input：[1,2,5] 3 [3,4] 2
Output：[1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation:
