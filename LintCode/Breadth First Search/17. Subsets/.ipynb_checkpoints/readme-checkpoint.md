Given a set of distinct integers, return all possible subsets.

Example 1:
```
Input: [0]
Output:
[
  [],
  [0]
]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [1,2,3]
Output:
[
  [3],
  [1],
  [2],
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3],
  [2,3],
  [1,2],
  []
]
```
### Challenge
Can you do it in both recursively and iteratively?

### Notice
- Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order.
- The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.
