# Description
Given a number `n`, return the double factorial of the number.In mathematics, the product of all the integers from 1 up to some non-negative integer n that have the same parity (odd or even) as n is called the double factorial.

> We guarantee that the result does not exceed `long`.
> `n` is a positive integer

5!! = 5 * 3 * 1 = 15
```
## Example2:
```
