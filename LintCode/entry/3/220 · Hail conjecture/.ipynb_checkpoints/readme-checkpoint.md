# Description
Mathematicians have put forward a famous conjecture hail conjecture.
For any natural number `n`, if `n` is even, replace `n` with `n / 2`;
If `n` is odd, replace `n` with `3 * n + 1`.
According to this rule, the final result must be `1`.
How many times will the number change to 1?

> 1<=n<=1000
# Example
## Example 1:
```
Input: 
4
Output: 
2
Explanation: 
First round: 4 / 2 = 2
Second round: 2 / 2 = 1
The answer is 2
