Given two numbers, number `a` and number `b`. Find the greatest common divisor of the given two numbers.

Example1
```
Input: a = 10, b = 15
Output: 5
Explanation:
10 % 5 == 0
15 % 5 == 0
```
Example2
```
Input: a = 15, b = 30
Output: 15
Explanation:
15 % 15 == 0
30 % 15 == 0
```
### Notice
In mathematics, the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two or more integers, which are not all zero, is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers.
