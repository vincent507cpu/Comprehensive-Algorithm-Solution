# Description
Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

> 1. You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
> 2. Minimize the total number of operations.

# Example
## Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12],
Output: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0].
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [0, 0, 0, 3, 1],
Output: [3, 1, 0, 0, 0].
```
