Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number, target. Return the sum of the three integers.

# Example
## Example 1:
```
Input:[2,7,11,15],3
Output:20
Explanation:
2+7+11=20
```
Example 2:
```
Input:[-1,2,1,-4],1
Output:2

# Challenge
O(n^2) time, O(1) extra space

# Notice
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
