Given an array of integers, find how many `unique pairs` in the array such that their sum is equal to a specific target number. Please return the number of pairs.

# Example
## Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,2,45,46,46], target = 47 
Output: 2
Explanation:

1 + 46 = 47
2 + 45 = 47
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,1], target = 2 
Output: 1
