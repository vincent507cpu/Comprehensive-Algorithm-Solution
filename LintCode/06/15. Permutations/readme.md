Given a list of numbers, return all possible permutations.

Example 1:
```

Output:
[
  [1]
]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [1,2,3]
Output:
[
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3,2],
  [2,1,3],
  [2,3,1],
  [3,1,2],
  [3,2,1]
]
```
### Challenge
Do it without recursion.

### Notice
You can assume that there is no duplicate numbers in the list.
