Given an array of integers, find how many pairs in the array such that their sum is `less than or equal to` a specific target number. Please return the number of pairs.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 24. 
Output: 5. 
Explanation:
2 + 7 < 24
2 + 11 < 24
2 + 15 < 24
7 + 11 < 24
7 + 15 < 24
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1], target = 1. 
Output: 0.
