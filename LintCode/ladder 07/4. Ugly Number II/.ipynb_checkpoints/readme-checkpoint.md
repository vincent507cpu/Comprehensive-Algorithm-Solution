Ugly number is a number that only have prime factors `2`, `3` and `5`.

Design an algorithm to find the nth ugly number. The first 10 ugly numbers are `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12...`

# Example
## Example 1:
```
Input: 9
Output: 10
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 1
Output: 1
```
# Challenge
O(n log n) or O(n) time.

# Notice
Note that `1` is typically treated as an ugly number.
