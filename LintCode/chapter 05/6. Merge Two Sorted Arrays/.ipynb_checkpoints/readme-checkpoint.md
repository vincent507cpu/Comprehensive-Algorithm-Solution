Merge two given sorted ascending integer array A and B into a new sorted integer array.

Example 1:
```
Input:  A=[1], B=[1]
Output: [1,1]	
Explanation:  return array merged.
```
Example 2:
```
Input:  A=[1,2,3,4], B=[2,4,5,6]
Output: [1,2,2,3,4,4,5,6]	
Explanation: return array merged.
```
### Challenge
How can you optimize your algorithm if one array is very large and the other is very small?
