Given the root of a binary search tree and 2 numbers min and max, trim the tree such that all the numbers in the new tree are between min and max (inclusive). The resulting tree should still be a valid binary search tree. So, if we get this tree as input:
![](bst.png)
and weâ€™re given min value as 5 and max value as 13, then the resulting binary search tree should be:
![](bst_trim.png)
Example1
```
Input: 
{8,3,10,1,6,#,14,#,#,4,7,13}
5
13
Output: {8, 6, 10, #, 7, #, 13}
