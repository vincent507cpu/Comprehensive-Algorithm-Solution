Given an array `nums` of n integers, find two integers in nums such that the sum is closest to a given number, target.

Return the absolute value of difference between the sum of the two integers and the target.

# Example
## Example1
```
Input:  nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4] and target = 4
Output: 1
Explanation:
The minimum difference is 1. (4 - (2 + 1) = 1).
```
Example2
```
Input:  nums = [-1, -1, -1, -4] and target = 4
Output: 6
Explanation:
The minimum difference is 6. (4 - (- 1 - 1) = 6).
```
# Challenge
Do it in O(nlogn) time complexity.
