Given an array of integers, find how many pairs in the array such that their sum is bigger than a specific target number. Please return the number of pairs.

# Example
## Example 1:
```
Input: [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 24
Output: 1
Explanation: 11 + 15 is the only pair.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [1, 1, 1, 1], target = 1
Output: 6
```
# Challenge
Do it in O(1) extra space and O(nlogn) time.
