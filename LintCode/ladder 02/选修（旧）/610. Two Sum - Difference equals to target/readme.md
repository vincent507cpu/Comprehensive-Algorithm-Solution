Given an sorted array of integers, find two numbers that their `difference` equals to a target value.

return a list with two number like `[num1, num2]` that the difference of `num1` and `num2` equals to target value, and `num1` is less than `num2`.

# Example
## Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2, 7, 15, 24], target = 5 
Output: [2, 7] 
Explanation:
(7 - 2 = 5)
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1, 1], target = 0
Output: [1, 1] 
Explanation:
(1 - 1 = 0)
```
