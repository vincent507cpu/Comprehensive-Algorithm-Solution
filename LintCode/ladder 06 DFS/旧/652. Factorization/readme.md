A non-negative numbers can be regarded as product of its factors.
Write a function that takes an integer n and return all possible combinations of its factors.

# Example
## Example1
```
Input: 8
Output: [[2,2,2],[2,4]]
Explanation:
8 = 2 x 2 x 2 = 2 x 4
```
Example2
```
Input: 1
Output: []
```
# Notice
- Elements in a combination (a1, a2, … , ak) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a1 ≤ a2 ≤ … ≤ ak).
- The solution set must not contain duplicate combination.
