The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens attack each other(Any two queens can't be in the same row, column, diagonal line).

Given an integer `n`, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where `'Q'` and `'.'` each indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

# Example
## Example 1:
```
Input:1
Output:
   [["Q"]]
```

Example 2:
```
Input:4
Output:
[
  // Solution 1
  [".Q..",
   "...Q",
   "Q...",
   "..Q."
  ],
  // Solution 2
  ["..Q.",
   "Q...",
   "...Q",
   ".Q.."
  ]
]
```
# Challenge
Can you do it without recursion?
