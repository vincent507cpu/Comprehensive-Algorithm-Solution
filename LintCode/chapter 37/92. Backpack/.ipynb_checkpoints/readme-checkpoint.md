Given n items with size Ai, an integer m denotes the size of a backpack. How full you can fill this backpack?

# Example
## Example 1:
```
	Input:  [3,4,8,5], backpack size=10
	Output:  9
```
## Example 2:
```
	Input:  [2,3,5,7], backpack size=12
	Output:  12
```
# Challenge
O(n x m) time and O(m) memory.

O(n x m) memory is also acceptable if you do not know how to optimize memory.

# Notice
You can not divide any item into small pieces.
