Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

# Example
## Example 1:
```
Input: nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1], nums2 = [2, 2], 
Output: [2].
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums1 = [1, 2], nums2 = [2], 
Output: [2].
```
# Challenge
Can you implement it in three different algorithms?

# Notice
Each element in the result must be unique.
The order of the results needs to be ascending
