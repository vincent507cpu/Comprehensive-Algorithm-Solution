Given a string `S`, find the longest palindromic substring in `S`. You may assume that the maximum length of `S` is 1000, and there exists one unique longest palindromic substring.

# Example
## Example 1:
```
Input:"abcdzdcab"
Output:"cdzdc"
```
Example 2:
```
Input:"aba"
Output:"aba"
```
# Challenge
O(n2) time is acceptable. Can you do it in O(n) time.
