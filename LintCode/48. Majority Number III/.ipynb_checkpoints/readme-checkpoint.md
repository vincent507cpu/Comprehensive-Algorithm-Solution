Given an array of integers and a number k, the majority number is the number that occurs `more than 1/k` of the size of the array.

Find it.

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,1,2,3,2,3,3,4,4,4] and k=3, 
Output: 3.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [1,1,2] and k=3, 
Output: 1.
```
### Challenge
O(n) time and O(k) extra space

### Notice
There is only one majority number in the array.
