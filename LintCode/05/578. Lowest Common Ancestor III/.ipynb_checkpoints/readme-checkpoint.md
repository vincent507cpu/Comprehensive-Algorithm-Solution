Given the root and two nodes in a Binary Tree. Find the lowest common ancestor(LCA) of the two nodes.
The lowest common ancestor is the node with largest depth which is the ancestor of both nodes.
Return `null` if LCA does not exist.

Example1
```
Input: 
{4, 3, 7, #, #, 5, 6}
3 5
5 6
6 7 
5 8
Output: 
4
7
7
null
Explanation:

 / \
3   7
   / \
  5   6

LCA(3, 5) = 4
LCA(5, 6) = 7
LCA(6, 7) = 7
LCA(5, 8) = null
```
Example2
```
Input:
{1}
1 1
Output: 
1
Explanation:
The tree is just a node, whose value is 1.
```
### Notice
node A or node B may not exist in tree.

Each node has a different value
