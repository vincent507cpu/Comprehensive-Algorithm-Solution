Given the `root` of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

 

# Example 1:
![](symtree1.jpg)
```
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true
```
# Example 2:
![](symtree2.jpg)
```
Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
Output: false
```

# Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
